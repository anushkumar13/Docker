#  Docker Learning Journal

This repo is my personal log of learning Docker — day by day.  
I’m using this space to track what I learn, break down concepts in my own words, and note anything important I want to remember later.

##  What's Inside

You'll find daily notes, summaries, and code snippets as I explore Docker — starting from the basics and going deeper step by step.  
I’m not aiming to just “read and forget” — I’m documenting things here so I understand them well enough to explain them back.

### Topics I’ll be covering include:

- Docker architecture  
- Images and containers  
- Docker CLI and Dockerfiles  
- Volumes and networks  
- Docker Compose  
- DockerHub and private registries  
- Real-world project setups  
- ...and anything else that comes up along the way

## 📅 Progress Log

I'll update this section as I go:

- **Day 1** → [Intro to Docker, container basics](day1.md)  
- **Day 2** → [](day2.md)  
- **Day 3** → *coming soon*  
*(and so on...)*

##  Study Resources

I'm learning Docker primarily from the following:

- **Book:** *"Docker Deep Dive (2025 Edition)" by Nigel Poulton*  
  This book covers everything from core Docker concepts to advanced usage — explained in a way that's easy to grasp but still practical for real-world work.  
  Any notes or summaries I write here will be based mostly on this book.

> Might also refer to official docs or articles occasionally, but the main base is Nigel’s book.

##  Why this repo?

This isn’t a tutorial for others — it’s my personal journey. But if you happen to stumble here and find it helpful, cool.  
If not, that’s fine too. The goal is simple: learn Docker well enough to use it confidently in real projects.
